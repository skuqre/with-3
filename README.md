Repo for w/^3 -- An FNF mod

[Mod link](https://gamebanana.com/mods/335499)

## Technical stuff / what I put or improved?
I put a LOT of changes because I thought it would be just another engine. It grew to be a mod instead.
- **Replays (STILL BETA)**
    - Records presses
    - Uses Note Difference for ratings
- **Botplay**
    - Made it strumtime-based (it was based on a note's y axis before)
    - Will put a warning when a section/s has more than 200 notes
    - You can change the scroll speed (when it's default) while in Botplay
- **Options Changes**
    - Checkboxes for "on/off" options (e.g. Health Bar Colors, etc.)
    - Dangerous Settings are prompted
    - Playfield BG Transparency: The name may be long but it's just Lane Cover Transparency
    - Note Skins: Oh yeah baby mhm oh yeah
    - Changed "Accuracy" to "Info Text - Simple/Extensive"
    - Modifiers or whatever you call them

will add more shit later
