SKINS TIME SWAG

So, you want to add a skin. How?

Here are some needed files:
- NOTE_assets.png
- NOTE_assets.xml
(if you want to see the ".png" or ".xml", open the
"View" tab at the top of the file explorer and tick
"File name extensions" :))

If they're not named like that,
rename them both to "NOTE_assets",
then open the XML file, and the second line
should look like something like this,
<TextureAtlas imagePath="exampleNameDontMindThis.png">
change "exampleNameDontMindThis.png" (or just the words inside the quote marks) to "NOTE_assets.png" and save
and you should have your needed files.

Now, adding a skin is quite easy,
go to assets/images/skins, and create a new folder.
you can't name your folder "default"! name it something
unique, like "my awesome skin" or something.

Once you have done that, copy your 2 files (NOTE_assets.png and NOTE_assets.xml)
and paste them in the folder that you have created.

Once you have done all that, you can reopen the Note Skins menu and have your
skin registered. It should load in quick. I hope.
