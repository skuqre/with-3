"funkerin.otf" is a modified version of 
https://github.com/FunkinModdingPlus/ModdingPlus/blob/master/assets/fonts/funkin.otf

it's been modified to look more like how the Alphabet class makes it
also so that dialogues dont null out (it's so buggy)

--

also, not sure where Funkin Modding Plus got the font, when I was exporting it,
credits had Rozebud on it
